//   D â€” Dependency Inversion
// - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.
// - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

// High-level Module(or Class): Class that executes an action with a tool.
// Low-level Module (or Class): The tool that is needed to execute the action
// Abstraction: Represents an interface that connects the two Classes.
// Details: How the tool works

// This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
